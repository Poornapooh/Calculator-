**🧮 Simple Calculator using HTML & JavaScript**

**📘 Project Overview:**

This project is a Simple Web-Based Calculator designed to perform basic arithmetic 
operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
It is created using HTML for the structure and JavaScript for the logic and 
interactivity. The project demonstrates how web technologies can be combined to 
build functional, interactive web applications.

**💡 Key Features:**

✳️ User-friendly interface for entering numbers.
➕ Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
⚡ Instant results displayed without refreshing the page.
🚫 Includes error handling for division by zero.
💻 Fully functional on any modern web browser.

**🛠️ Technologies Used:**

**Component	          Technology**
1. Frontend Structure	     HTML5
2. Scripting / Logic	     JavaScript (ES6)
3. Platform	             Web Browser (Client-side)

**⚙️ How It Works: **
1. The user enters two numbers into input boxes.
2. By clicking one of the operation buttons (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide),
   a JavaScript function is executed.
3. The function reads the numbers, performs the corresponding calculation, and
    displays the result dynamically in the result field.
4. If the user tries to divide by zero, a warning message (Cannot divide by zero)
    is shown.

**🚀 How to Run the Project: **

1. Download or clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-calculator.git

2. Open the file calci.html in any web browser.
3. Enter two numbers and perform the desired operation.

**📂 Project File:**

calci.html → Contains both HTML structure and JavaScript logic in one file.

**🧠 Learning Outcomes:**

1. Understanding how HTML and JavaScript work together.
2. Gaining practical knowledge in DOM manipulation and event handling.
3. Building simple interactive web tools using client-side scripting.
